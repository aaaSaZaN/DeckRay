# DeckRay

Decky Loader plugin for Steam Deck that enables VLESS proxy connections with Reality protocol support.

## Features

- **Import VLESS Configurations** — via URL (single node or subscription)
- **Connection Toggle** — turn proxy on/off from Quick Access
- **TUN Mode** — system-wide traffic routing, **recommended for Gaming Mode**
- **Kill Switch** — block traffic when proxy disconnects (optional)

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Steam Deck with [Decky Loader](https://wiki.deckbrew.xyz/) installed.

- **Plugin Store (recommended):** Decky Loader → Plugin Store → search "DeckRay" → Install.
- **Desktop Mode (one-click):** Download [Install-DeckRay.desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaaSaZaN/DeckRay/main/scripts/Install-DeckRay.desktop), set executable (Properties → Permissions), double-click to run. See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md).
- **Manual:** Download [latest release](https://github.com/aaaSaZaN/DeckRay/releases/latest) zip → Decky Loader → Settings → Developer → Install Plugin from URL → paste zip URL.

**TUN mode (recommended):** In Gaming Mode, Steam does not respect system SOCKS proxy settings — games and most system services ignore it. TUN mode creates a virtual network interface that routes **all** system traffic through the proxy, making it the only reliable way to proxy traffic in Gaming Mode. Enable TUN in the plugin settings; no extra setup is required.

Without TUN, the plugin falls back to SOCKS proxy mode, which works in Desktop Mode but may not cover games and system services in Gaming Mode.

**Usage, troubleshooting, more:** [GitHub Pages docs](https://aaasazan.github.io/DeckRay/).
